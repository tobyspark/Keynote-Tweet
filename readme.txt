// INFO

Keynote Tweet is a simple AppleScript utility that allows you to send tweets from your Keynote presentations.

It was started by Ideo Labs (?) and hosted here: http://code.google.com/p/keynotetweet/
The Twitter OAuthpocalypse came, broke its posting method, and it wasn't updated.

Splatdot.com updated to use a different posting technique. http://splatdot.com/the-oauthpocalypse-and-keynote-tweet/

This is that, now modified by Toby Harris (tobyz.net) to be able to handle multiple tweets per slide and hosted on github. So now you can tweet the slide's text and the asides, links etc. to go with it.

// INSTALL

In order for the script to work, you'll need to install and configure twurl. You can find the twurl download and documentation here:

To run the script, simply double-click the Keynote Tweet 2 icon. To edit it, open the same file in AppleScript Editor (formerly Script Editor). Note that you cannot run this or any 'Stay-Open' script from the editor, but must run it as an application instead.
